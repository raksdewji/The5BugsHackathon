### A plugin security/fire detection solution

Our product allows peace of mind and fire detection for everyone, even when away from home. The device can be connected to our phone app, which allows the user to arm the security system when leaving the house, and disarm it when coming back. The hardware includes a motion sensor, which notifies the user via text when movement is detected if the system is armed. The smoke sensor is always active, and also notifies the user if smoke and/or various toxic gases are detected.

This discrete multipurpose home solution will not alert possible intruders that you have a home security system, increasing likelihood that said perpetrator is caught. Possible expanding possibilities include a video feed that shows activity, or even the ability to notify authorities with the touch of a button.

With further development time, our app would show the current arm status of the device, and allow the user to add/change multiple phone numbers to notify families and/or multiple individuals such as neighbours, friends, family, etc.
